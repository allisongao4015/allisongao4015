### Hi! Thank you for checking out my Github Profile. ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent Flatiron Data Science Bootcamp grad with a passion for data, tech, and public policy. 

## Projects 

#### [Predicting Civil Ticket Fine Collection Outcome](https://github.com/allisongao4015/oath_cases)
* Classify whether an issued civil ticket in NYC will result in fine collection using machine learning
* Analyzed over 210,000 civil tickets issued in New York City using 25 associated variables 
* Automated download of over 200 files from the Census Bureau using Selenium
* Ran iterations of logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost models to select best model
* Selected XGBoost as the preferred model with 71% accuracy score and 66% precision score 

#### [Tweet Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/allisongao4015/NLP_project)
* Classify Tweets on Google and Apple products into positive emotion, negative emotion or no emotion detected
* Trained 4 different machine learning classification models 
* Used different text vectorization tools and machine learning tools to fix class imbalance
* Identified Multinomial Bayes as the best model with a 77% macro precision score 

#### [Classifying Risk of Injury for Traffic Crashes](https://github.com/allisongao4015/Project_3_Classification)
* Multiclass classification modeling to predict risk of injury resulting from traffic crashes in Chicago
* Merged 3 datasets with over 550,000 observations for analysis 
* Ran multiple machine learning models and used grid search to identify best parameters 
* Selected XGBoost as the preferred model with 95% accuracy score and 87% in macro precision score 

#### [Predicting House Price in King County, Washington](https://github.com/allisongao4015/Phase_2_Project)
* Linear regression modeling to analyze a myriad of housing factorsâ€™ impact on house price in King County
* Used home sale data on 15,000 houses and 23 variables to conduct linear regression modeling 
* Analyzed and interpreted variablesâ€™ coefficients to identify important features associated with house price
